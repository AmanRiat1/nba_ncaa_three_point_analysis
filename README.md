# nba-ncaa-three-point-analysis

## Purpose
A popular metric NBA draft scouts use to evaluate how well a prospect may shoot in the NBA is their free throw percentage. This notebook seeks to collect data from players who played in the NBA in the last twenty years and see how well this metric holds up.

## Notes
If running the notebook locally, to make the plots interactive remove the `"svg"` string in every line of code that says `fig.show()`
